# Project Name

This project was about creating my own version of the board game Guess Who?

## The problem

My plan for this project was to do it step by step, start with step one finish it and then move on to the next step. I also wanted to go through the past weeks material from technigo coursematerial to be able to solve the problems that may appear. I struggled a lot during this project already from the beginning. I approached my problems by asking a teammember for help so we could code along and I could get an explanation on how to solve things. That helped me with the startfunction and filtercharacter. I also searched for questions about the guess who project in stackOverflow and got some answers that could help me with chechQuestion. I used console.log to be able to find out where the problem was when one function after another one didn't work. What also helped was the demo time with my technigo team. I got a lot of smart solutions explained during that time.
